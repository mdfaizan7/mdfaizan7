Somewhere around 2020, I jumped into coding, and it's been quite the journey. From [startups](https://www.getpowerplay.in/) to a [major corporation](https://about.google/), I've been exploring different tech worlds and loving every bit of it.

Currently, I'm working at [Google](https://developers.google.com/), dedicated to streamlining the developer experience. We're brainstorming exciting projects aimed at helping developers not only succeed but also enjoy the process!

When I'm not coding, you'll find me hitting the gym, diving into fanfictions, or gaming on both Xbox and PS5 (couldn't choose just one!). Also, I'm just a total cat person üê±.
